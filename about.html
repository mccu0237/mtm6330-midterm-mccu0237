        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I love anything having to do with the media world. It is a place where I can express my art and design. The options are infinite when it comes to creating content. The media field is constantly changing which is why it is such a great field because there is always something new.  Technology is our future and there are so many ways we can be creative with it. We can inspire so many people with just a simple creation, which is something I want to be a part of.
        Graphic design, photography, videography, content management,  and web development are all trades I have learnt over the last year and a half. Whilst none of them are easy jobs, they are all extremely interesting and allow for me to fully let my creative and technical side be used. </p>

                    <p>These photos were taken in Florence Italy. FLorence is the capital of Italy’s Tuscany region. home to many masterpieces of Renaissance art and architecture, FLorence is the city of art. Travelling there a couple years ago, it was an amazing place to take pictures. From the architecture to the art, to the beautiful culture, these images capture the scenery and life of Florence. </p>

                       <p>Everything about Florence makes it perfect for photography. The time spent there was great for photos. There are so many wonderful art pieces and beautiful building. Roads builf of cobble stone, makes this place look like something off a post card. There is a lovely hill in which Piazzale michelangelo sits that over looks Florence and it makes for a wonderful place to take photos. Both these photos were taken from this hill.</p>
