            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will see my work ranging from photography, videos, graphic and user experience design. Mulitimedia is such an wonderful field of work. I love everything from the backend coding, to the front end design. I love  developing and creating new ideas. It is part of the job that makes this not feel like work. Being able to work yet feel like I'm not working is great. Everything about this allows me create work that is unique and each piece has a unique twist to it.</p>

             <p>Portraits are some of my favourite pictures to take. They are very real and offer a lot of emotion. They show the art of uniqueness between each person. They hold stories about each individual. Portraits allow the viewers to connect to something. They can feel the emotion in the picture, and they connect to how the portraits make them feel. </p>

                <p>As for photography, it is one of my favourite things. I love being able to capture a moment in time. It can freeze any moment and it is kept like that forever. Photography is an art. It looks a the finer details that we miss in life. Whether it is a portrait or a picture of the sun setting, these are all moments that we capture and we can really look at the smaller details </p>
